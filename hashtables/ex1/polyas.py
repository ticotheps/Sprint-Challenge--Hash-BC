# Understanding the Problem
#   -You have: 
#       -a package with weight limit called 'limit'.
#       -a list of 'weights' (representing the different weights of
#           many items).

#   -Objective:
#       -find TWO items from that list of 'weights' whose weights add 
#           up to the 'limit' (of the given package).
#       -return a tuple that contains the INDEX of each of the above
#           discovered items.

#   -Constraints:
#       -returned tuple should look like this => (zero, one)
#       -the items in the tuple are NOT the weights of the items, but
#           rather, the INDEX of those items.
